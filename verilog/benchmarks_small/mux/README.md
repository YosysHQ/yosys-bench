# Small multiplexers

The python script generates a selection of multiplexer descriptions, using variable 
length index (e.g. `assign a = b [c]`) as well as `case` and `if`-`else if`-`else` 
styles, across a variety of power-of-2 and non-power-of-2 values for number of
inputs, as well as input width.
