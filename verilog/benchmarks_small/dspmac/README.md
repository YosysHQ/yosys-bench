# DSPMAC - A multiply-accumulate DSP structure

This module takes two fixed-point operands (A and B) and can perform the following operations:

* CLEAR - the accumulator is loaded with 0.
* MUL   - the accumulator is set to A*B.
* MAC   - the result of A*B is added to the accumulator.
* NOP   - the accumulator is left untouched.

Several verions of the module are generated by the Python script,
differing in the number of input and output bits.

This module forms the computational heart of FIR/IIR filter engines
and generic DSP processors.
