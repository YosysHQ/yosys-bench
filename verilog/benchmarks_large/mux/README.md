# Large multiplexers

The python script generates a selection of multiplexer descriptions, using variable 
length index (e.g. `assign a = b [c]`) as well as `case` and `if`-`else` (balanced
and unbalanced) styles, across a variety of power-of-2 and non-power-of-2 values
for a number of inputs, as well as input width.
