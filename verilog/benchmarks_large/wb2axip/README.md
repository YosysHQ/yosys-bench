# WB2AXIP: A Pipelined Wishbone B4 to AXI4 bridge

Source: https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip

Currently, just one design:

- **AXILXBAR** is a fully functional, formally verified,
    N master to M slave AXI-lite crossbar interconnect.
    As such, it permits min(N,M) active channel connections
    between masters and slaves all at once.
