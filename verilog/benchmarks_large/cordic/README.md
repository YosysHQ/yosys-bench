# CORDIC - Coordinate Rotation DIgital Computer

The CORDIC is a class of algorithm is used to efficiently calculate sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine, arccos, arctangent, vector magnitude and more.

Here, a pipelined CORDIC algorithm is used to calculate sine and cosine.

The Python script generates multiple versions varying in the number of CORDIC stages and input widths.
