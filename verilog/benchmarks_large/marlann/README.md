# MARLANN - Multiply-Accumulate and Rectified-Linear Accelerator for Neural Networks

Source: https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/MARLANN

Currently, `marlann_compute.v` is a modified version of the `rtl/compute.v` design
found upstream but with direct instantiations removed in favour of generic RTL for
inference.
