========================================
      Simple Cell Lib version 1.0
========================================

This is a minimal cell library for benchmarking purposes.
It contains process-agnostic cells with just one drive strength.
Cell sizes are given in units of the inverter size.
This library is solely meant to be uses for benchmarking and is unfit for any purpose.

The following cells are present in the library:

* inverter.
* tri-state inverter.
* 2-input nand.
* 2-input nor.
* 2-input xor.
* 2-input inverting mux.
* D-type flip-flop with reset and preset.
