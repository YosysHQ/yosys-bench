      Supergate Cell Lib version 1.0
========================================

This is a cell library for benchmarking purposes.
The library is based on the 'simple' cell library but additionally
contains a half-adder, full-adder, AOI221 and OAI221 cells.

The cells are process-agnostic with just one drive strength.
Cell sizes are given in units of the inverter size.
This library is solely meant to be uses for benchmarking and is unfit for any purpose.

The following cells are present in the library:

* inverter.
* tri-state inverter.
* 2-input nand.
* 2-input nor.
* 2-input xor.
* 2-input inverting mux.
* D-type flip-flop with reset and preset.
* half-adder cell.
* full-adder cell.
* and-or-invert 211 cell.
* or-and-invert 211 cell.
